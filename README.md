A recipe and ingredient management environment
The idea is to build a comprehensive app for recipe management. Users can easily add recipes through web links, copy-paste or even screen grabs. The app can use OCR to import apps that come from images.  The app can allow the user to search and filter recipes based on meal, food, and dietary preferences. Eventually, it could support grocery management, so that recipes could be suggested based on a userâ€™s current inventory of ingredients. Bar code scanning could be used to enable users to add grocery items to their inventory. In addition, the app could build shopping lists based on what the user wants to eat on a given day or in a given week.
