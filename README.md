# bp-recipe
A comprehensive recipe management app built using the MERN stack as a CptS 489 team project.
Deployed to https://recipe.bfapp.org

## State of the project at Start of Fa20

This semester we created the user management platform. We also implemented the ability to add, view, edit, 
and delete recipes. You can sort and filter recipes as well. 

## Future enhancements recommended by previous project team
In the future, teams could add recipe scaling (the ability to double/half recipe quantities). Future teams could
also integrate recipe management and grocery management. We would also like a future team to add a social feature
where users can like and comment on recipes. There is lots of room to build off of this base app and get creative!
